vendor prefixes, how do i solve them, oh there's this new cool thing called css-pre-processors, let's pick Less or maybe Sass...

we definitely need some streaming in there, the figures only update once a minute but what the hey, let's use web sockets

<div>HTML5</div>
<!--
My name is...,
In case the last slide didin't make clear I'm very much into HTML5, unlike my fellow presenters I've never been a fan of plug-ins so I genuinely think HTML5 is the best thing since sliced bread.
I've been making webapps for 6 years, which as Colin introduced, given the pace of the web is an eternity
We've all seen applets come and go, plugins have largely come and gone
And we've also seen our share of buzzwords come and go, AJAX, RIA, Web2.0 and now HTML5
I'm going to talk about what HTML5 really is but first I want to tell a little story

  <b>Apps <i>will</i> be easier to create</b><br/>
  <b>Apps <i>will</i> be more powerful</b>

<!-- 1. A universal acceptance that browsers can and will host apps, 2. A standards process to ensure that in the future those apps will-->
<div class="l">
  Browsers <i>are</i> hosting apps<br/>
  Apps <i>will</i> be easier to create<br/>
  <b>Apps <i>will</i> be more powerful</b>

<!-- a. Be easier to write -->
<div class="l">
  Browsers <i>are</i> hosting apps<br/>
  Apps <i>will</i> be easier to create<br/>
  Apps <i>will</i> be more powerful
</div>
<!-- b. Have access to more functionality -->
<div><i>will?</i></div>
<div>So, there's nothing new?</div>
<!-- That's a lot of wills, is there nothing now?-->
<div>No, there's <i>loads</i> of new stuff!</div>
<!-- I name checked at the start a tiny fraction of the frameworks, shims and tools that have been developed in the last few years. Everyone wants to write those HTML5 apps now, -->
<div>Everyone (+ &#x1f415;)</div>
<div>Everyone (+ dog)</div>
<!-- and everyone (and their dog) has written frameworks, shims and tools to make that happen. That means that there's a massive variation in -->
<div>Quality</div>
<!-- the quality of this stuff, but that's nothing new in software. However, there's also huge variation in -->
<div>Niche</div>
<!-- the niche that these frameworks are targeting.


This is often forgotten on the web, people write a huge variation of content for the web designed to fulfill very different purposes. -->

<div>Apps</div>
<!-- At one extreme you have Google making something very productivity based like the Docs app-->
<div>Sites</div>
<!-- and on the other end you've got pre-dominantly non-interactive content like the BBC News site-->
<div>App == Site</div>
<!-- In one sense both of these examples are very similar, they are both -->
<div>HTTP</div>
<!-- served over the web, -->
<div>Browser</div>
<!-- viewed in a browser and -->
<div>HTML<br/>JavaScript<br/>CSS</div>
<!-- exist within the constraints of the same technologies. -->
<div>App != Site</div>
<!-- However, they're also clearly very different from a user's perspective --->
<div>App &lt; Site</div>
<!-- so is a site better than an app -->
<div>Quick</div>
<!--just loading the content-->
<div>Smooth</div>
<!--browsers are heavily optimised for displaying content -->
<div>App &gt; Site?</div>
<!--in that case is an app better than a site-->
<div>No loading bar</div>
<!--beyond the initial load which can be quite a bit slower-->
<div>Interactivity</div>
<!-- these are all the hallmarks of "apps". So am I saying you should write an app or write a site-->
<div>Neither...</div>
<!-- They both have their place, it depends on the nature of the content and the expected user interaction. And it's better to look at it as-->

<div>Site &#x2192; App<br/><i>continuum</i></div>
<!-- a continuum!  -->
<div>All projects exist<br/><i>somewhere</i><br/> on the continuum</div>
<!-- And all HTML5 projects fit somewhere along it, wikipedia, Twitter. -->
<div>Unique to HTML5</div>
<!-- ... not in c#, not in java, came about because of the webs history, an app environment born out of a linked document environment. I think that's cool -->
<div>So...</div>
<!-- what's the benefit of identifying the continuum?-->
<div>Benefit?</div>
<!--
In the same way that there were user perceivable differences, there are also different technical and architectural challenges at every point along the continuum.
So as the community has developed frameworks, shims and tools to help with these challenges in their own projects, it follows they've been developed
to be most effective in one specific range on the continuum.-->
<div>Analyse <i>your</i><br/>project</div>
<!--So it follows that by identifying where your project sites on the continuum you can get a better idea of what's an appropriate choice.-->

<!--For instance, all of the projects I've named
are massive internet properties, which have very demanding performance, reliability and scalability needs. They are also the result of
huge investment, are worked on by large teams and are likely to be maintained for a long time to come.

(Therefore many of them make heavy use of caching, server pre-rendering of content)

Contrasted to many enterprise sites, where the requirements are often far less demanding, the teams are often a lot smaller and therefore the costs are a lot lower.
Other smaller sites also differ, where they may be developed by an individual and may just as often be re-written as maintained.
